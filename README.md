Hello, my name is Alvin and welcome to my github respository. I mainly use this to show employers the work that I code in my free time, whilst also learning more about certain programming languages than I did at University.

This is also to help me personally, whenever I'm coding something, I can refer to one of my own projects and use the code that is coded into new work.

I'm not a master at anything, I'm just learning and improving my skills to hopefully land a job.
